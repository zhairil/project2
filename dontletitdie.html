		<p>Ever since it became popular in 2011, Minecraft has been a fun game loved by kids and adults. However, Microsoft took over Minecraft in 2014, which made the game worse. Roblox has has been a competitor to Minecraft for a long time and recently, Fortnite came close to taking the position of the most viewed game on YouTube from Minecraft. Minecraft is losing most of its valuable players to those games. To all people who left Minecraft for Roblox and Fortnite, please come back. <strong><em>Minecraft needs you.<em></strong></p>
