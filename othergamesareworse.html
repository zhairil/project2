	<p>You've heard a lot about how great Minecraft is. Now you can see how it compares to other games. The disadvantage it has over other the other games is that it costs $27 while the others are free. But the advantage it has over other games is huge.</p>
	
	<div class="page6grid">
	
		<h1 class="colspan2">Minecraft vs. Roblox</h1>

			<h2>Minecraft</h2>
		
			<p>Minecraft has a lot of freedom of what you can do. You can build anything you want and move around everywhere with no limits.</p>
		
		</div>
		
		<div>
			
			<h2>Roblox</h2>
			
			<p>In Roblox, you have to choose a game that was already made. It doesn't give you as much freedom as Minecraft</p>
			
		</div>
		
		<h1 class="colspan2">Minecraft vs. Fortnite</h1>
		
		<div>
			
			<h2>Minecraft</h2>
			
			<p>Again, Minecraft provides lots of freedom in what you can do in the game. It also has lots of combat-related features that are fun like swords and arrows. You can add guns to the game with mods.</p>
			
		</div>
		
		<div>
			
			<h2>Fortnite</h2>
			
			<p>Fortnite is partially based on Minecraft. Fortnite is just focused on fighting other people and fast paced action. It had some building mechanics but it's for self defense, not for creativity.</p>
